# Analysing contours in phonetic data: Dynamic analysis hands-on workshop using R
This repository contains materials for the workshop "Analysing contours in phonetic data: Dynamic analysis hands-on workshop using R". 2-3 April, 2025, University of Milan.

Here is the event URL: https://site.unibo.it/akid/en/agenda/analysing-contours-in-phonetic-data-dynamic-analysis-hands-on-workshop-using-r

## What the repository contains

The workshop materials include:

- **data** folder: containing data sets used in the workshop

- **HTML** documents: the main workshop materials detailing analysis workflow

- **Rmd** documents: R Markdown documents knitted to create HTML documents

- **image** folder: some png files included in the document

- **ultrasound** folder: data set for the ultrasound workshop on Day 3 (optional)

## Workshop schedule

The main objective of the workshop is to compare **static** and **dynamic** analysis methods of spectral data and discuss how these methods can be applied for the workshop participant's own research. Specific methods to be covered include:

- Day 1 Session 1: **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

- Day 1 Session 2: **Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA)**

- Day 2 Session 1: **Linear Mixed-Effect Models (LMEs)**

- Day 2 Session 2: **Generalised Additive Mixed-Effect Models (GAMMs)**

The workshop is contexualised in my own research and will utilise existing data sets from my publication:

## Optional ultrasound tongue imaging workshop (Day 3)

Some members of the audience will continue onto Day 3 for a brief workshop on ultrasound tongue imaging. This repository contains some materials for this -- see the day 3 HTML/Rmd documents.

The aim of the ultrasound workshop is to casually discuss ultrasound data collection/analysis methods. We may not be able to discuss the workshop materials much, but I've prapared a document containing an extension of my own research (see below for citation) in which I have analysed the dynamic changes in tongue shape using FPCA and GAMMs.
